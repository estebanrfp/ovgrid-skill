# 3. The resources: the build file, and what it may be made of

A build is one JSON object: objects of parts — prim shapes or *kinds* — dressed in the bank's
materials, with their lights, particles and behaviours; linked clones of objects; trees. Every
name it may use — shapes, kinds and their parameters, behaviours, particles, the 2,812 materials,
the 31 tree species — is in **catalog.json**, made from the world's own code, one entry a line.

```json
{
  "name": "Millbrook",
  "anchor": { "at": [1656179.74, 3488786.27, -5053222.57], "heading": 30.77 },
  "prims": [ { "name": "square", "shape": "cube", "at": [0, 0, 0.04], "size": [18, 18, 0.2], "material": "paving/cobblestone/cobblestone-pavement" } ],
  "objects": [ { "name": "bakery", "at": [-12, 6, 0.35], "turn": [0, 0, -80], "prims": [ … ] },
               { "name": "lamp", "at": [6, 6], "prims": [ … ] } ],
  "clones": [ { "of": "lamp", "at": [-6, -6], "turn": [0, 0, 90] } ],
  "trees": [ { "species": "oak", "at": [24, 30], "seed": 3, "scale": 1.1 } ],
  "views": [ { "name": "square", "eye": [0, -14], "look": [0, 4, 2], "hour": 16 } ]
}
```

## Anchor and frame

- `anchor.at`: a planet-centred point (m) on or near the ground; `anchor.heading`: the azimuth
  (° from north, east positive) the build's +y faces. `"exact": true` makes `at` the frame's origin
  itself rather than a point over the ground — a survey's anchor, an export's. Without an anchor the
  person places the build where they point (deliver.md). Where anchors come from: site.md.
- **The frame**: on the ground under the anchor (or at it, exact). x right, y ahead, z up — right as seen from in front of the build, looking back
  at it from +y; for whoever faces +y, as a driver does or someone walking in along +y, +x is on the
  left. So a shop on the right of a square, as you face the square's front, stands at x > 0; and
  a car whose nose points to +y and keeps to the right of the road, as in Spain, has its driver at
  x > 0, on the driver's own left. z = 0 is
  that ground. Everything else in the file is in this frame, in metres.
- **A place** (`at` of an object, a clone, a tree): `[x, y]` is on the ground there — the import
  finds it — and `[x, y, z]` is z above the ground under the anchor. A prim's `at` is always
  `[x, y, z]`, in its object's frame.

## Prims

The parts of an object. `prims` at the top are the build's own object, standing at the anchor;
each of `objects` has its own (below).

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `name` | What it is (`"front wall 2"`); shown in the editor |
| `shape` | A preset (`cube`, `prism`, `pyramid`, `tetrahedron`, `cylinder`, `hemiCylinder`, `cone`, `hemiCone`, `sphere`, `hemiSphere`, `torus`, `tube`, `ring`) or the 18 shape integers |
| `kind` + its parameters | Instead of `shape`: a kind (below) |
| `at` | Its centre, m, in its object's frame |
| `size` | m along its own x, y, z: 0.01–64 each |
| `turn` | ° about x, then y, then z (default `[0, 0, 0]`) |
| `material` | A bank id: `category/subcategory/name` (catalog.json → `materials`) |
| `color` | Linear RGB 0–1 of untextured faces; with a material it shows only while the textures load and far away — leave it out |
| `surface` | How the material lies and what the faces do with light (below) |
| `light` | Its light (below) |
| `particles` | What it throws from its top: `"chimney"`, `"campfire"`, `"torch"`, `{ "preset": "steam" }`… (effects.md) |
| `phantom` / `collisionOnly` | `true`: walked through / not drawn (below) |
| `behaviour` | What it does by itself: opens on a click, turns, goes and comes back (below) |
| `script` | Its script, JavaScript as a string, for what no property can say (effects.md) |
| `seat` | `true`: sat on by a click, on its top, facing its +y — a bench, a chair, a vehicle's seat (vehicles.md) |
| `seed` | A rock's: whole number, one seed one rock (else one from the build's name and the part's place, the same at every import) |

### Shapes

`catalog.json` → `presets` gives each preset's faces in order (their index is the face's
number in `surface.faces`), where each faces as placed with no turn, and its triangles at the four
levels of detail. What to know:

- **cube**: faces 0 top, 1 −y, 2 +x, 3 +y, 4 −x, 5 bottom. Walls, floors, slabs, beams, boards,
  furniture — most of any build.
- **cylinder**: 0 top, 1 side, 2 bottom; its axis is its z. Lay it along x with `turn [0, 90, 0]`,
  along y with `[-90, 0, 0]` (logs, rails, a ridge pole).
- **prism** is a wedge: upright side at its −x, slope facing +x+z. Turn it `[0, 0, 180]` for the
  other half of a gable. Prefer the `roof` kind for roofs.
- **sphere, torus, tube, ring** are made upright by a turn of their own: their `size` is
  `[height, depth (y), width (x)]`, not `[x, y, z]`.
- **hemiSphere**: a dome, flat side down.
- **Hollow, cut, taper, twist**: a preset changed, its fields by name —
  `{ "preset": "cylinder", "hollow": 0.8 }` a well's wall (faces 0 top, 1 outside, 2 inside,
  3 bottom), `{ "preset": "hemiSphere", "hollow": 0.9 }` a lamp shade, `{ "preset": "cylinder",
  "profileBegin": 0.25, "profileEnd": 0.75 }` half round, `{ "preset": "cube", "scaleX": 0.6,
  "scaleY": 0.6 }` a tapered post. The fields (Second Life's prim parameters): `profileBegin`,
  `profileEnd` (0–1, a cut round its profile), `hollow` (0–0.99), `pathBegin`, `pathEnd` (0–1, a cut
  along its path), `scaleX`, `scaleY` (on a straight path the top's size, 1 as the bottom, 0 a point;
  on a circular one the hole's), `taperX`, `taperY` (−1–1, a circular path's taper), `twistBegin`,
  `twistEnd` (−1–1: ±180° along a straight path, ±360° round a circular one), `shearX`, `shearY`
  (±0.5, the top slid over), `revolutions` (1–4), `skew`, `radiusOffset` (coils, on circular paths).
  Hollowing or cutting adds faces (a hollow box: 5 the hollow, 6 bottom). Or the 18 integers
  themselves, as an export writes them.

### Kinds

A part may be of a kind: `{ "kind": "door", "at": […], "turn": […], "size": […], "style": "glazed",
"hinge": "right" }` — its parameters beside its other fields (or in `"params": {…}`), an option by
its name. Each number is held to its range and step — the check notes what was changed — and a
parameter or an option the kind has not is an error. Every kind,
its parameters (range, default, step, what each does), its faces and its triangles:
`catalog.json` → `kinds`. In short:

| Kind | Box (`size`) | Faces | Orientation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `door` | frame: width, wall thickness, height | 0 frame, 1 leaf, 2 glass, 3 handles | front −y; `hinge` seen from the front; `open` 0–110° swings out to the front |
| `window` | frame: width, ≤ wall thickness, height | 0 frame, 1 bars, 2 glass, 3 sill | front −y; the sill stands out of the box to the front |
| `roof` | all of it: width (along the ridge), depth, eaves to ridge | 0 roof, 1 ends (gables), 2 underside, 3 eaves | ridge along x; `shed` low at −y |
| `stairs` | made by `steps`, `height`, `tread`, `width` | 0 treads, 1 risers, 2 sides, 3 underside, 4 railing | rises towards +y; the railing stands above the box |
| `fence` | what its `points`, `thickness` and `height` make; or a `size`: a straight length along x | 0 posts, 1 rails, 2 pickets | a path of 2–32 `points`, a post on each and others every `spacing` m at most; the last on the first closes it round |
| `road` | what its `points`, `width` and `depth` make | 0 surface, 1 sides, 2 underside | a ribbon along 2–32 `points` laid on the ground, its slab `depth` under it; under 2 m wide a path; the last point on the first closes it round |
| `column` | plinth width, depth, height | 0 shaft, 1 base, 2 capital | upright |
| `arch` | width, wall depth, height | 0 its two faces, 1 the opening, 2 outside, 3 feet | wall in x–z, opening through y |
| `bevel` | its own | box: as a cube; cylinder: as a cylinder | `base` box or cylinder; `edge` round or chamfer, `radius` m |
| `rock` | width (y) and height (z); length (x) from `elongation` | 0 surface | flat `base` down; sink it a tenth of its height |

What is curved or organic — a vase, a column's swell, a cushion, a sofa, a handle, a hull — is not a
kind you write out: describe it with `"sculpt": { … }` (a lathe, a box, a loft, a sweep, or a model)
and the sculpt tool makes it a part of the `sculpt` kind, its map never typed by hand. → sculpt.md

**A fence along the land, in one part**: `points` in the part's own frame, written `[x, y]` without
heights, lie on the ground once placed — the fence follows it, a post on each point:

```json
{ "name": "garden fence", "kind": "fence", "at": [0, 0, 0], "style": "pickets", "height": 1,
  "points": [[-6, -5], [6, -5], [6, 5], [-6, 5], [-6, -1]] }
```

**A road or a path, in one part**: its `points` in its own frame — within 31.5 m of its `at`, so
stand it at their middle — written `[x, y]`: they are laid on the ground once placed, its surface on
the ground sampled under both edges about every metre. Gravel (`ground/gravel/rocky-trail`) unless
it has a `material`. Its slab goes `depth` (0.3 m) under its surface, so that where the drawn ground
is not quite where the samples say, no gap shows: on slopes, 0.4–0.6.

```json
{ "name": "lane", "at": [3.6, 32.8], "prims": [{ "name": "lane", "kind": "road", "at": [0, 0, 0], "width": 3,
  "points": [[-3.6, -24.2], [-2.8, -16.8], [-4, -8.8], [-2.4, -0.8], [0, 7.2], [2, 15.2], [3.6, 24.2]] }] }
```

A longer way is several roads end to end. A road on something built — a bridge's deck — takes
`[x, y, z]` points: it stays where they say.

A kind's uvs are in metres: its material lies at real size on every face. A kind whose mesh
depends on its size (door, window, roof, fence, arch, column, bevel) makes a mesh for each size
used: give alike parts the same size and they share it.

## Materials by use

Every material is real size: leave `scale` out and it tiles as it is in life. In catalog.json →
`materials`, each has its `uses` (wall, floor, roof, ground, road, fence, railing, furniture,
window, ceiling), its tile's `size` in metres, its average `color`, `metal` and its `look` (cut-out,
see-through, glows, moves); `categories` group them. Pick by role, then by colour:

| Role | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Walls | `masonry/brick`, `masonry/stone-blocks`, `masonry/rubble`, `plaster/plaster`, `plaster/concrete`, `wood/siding`, `wood/logs`; whole shop fronts `facade/facade` |
| Roofs | `roofing/tiles` (clay), `roofing/slate`, `roofing/thatch`; `metal/corrugated` for sheds |
| Floors inside | `wood/floor`, `paving/tiles`, `paving/stone`; rugs `fabric/carpet` |
| Squares, paths, lanes | `paving/cobblestone`, `paving/pavers`, `paving/stone`; tracks `ground/gravel`, `ground/soil`; roads `paving/asphalt`, `paving/roads` |
| Ground cover | `ground/grass`, `ground/sand`, `ground/rock`, `ground/leaves`, `ground/snow` |
| Wood: doors, frames, beams, furniture | `wood/planks`, `wood/painted`, `wood/panel`; seats `fabric/leather`, `fabric/wicker`, cushions `fabric/cloth` |
| Metal | `metal/bare`, `metal/painted`, `metal/rusted`, `metal/sheet` (with `metal`): lamp posts, railings, hinges, a bell |
| Glass | `glass/clear`, `glass/textured`, `glass/leaded` (`look`: see-through): small panes only |
| Water, lava | `effects/water`, `effects/lava` (`look`: moves, glows): a pond's surface, a fountain's basin, a forge |
| Fences, grates, nets | `openwork/fence`, `openwork/grate`, `openwork/net` (`look`: cut-out) |

Grep the catalog — `grep '"uses":\["roof"' catalog.json`, `grep -i thatch catalog.json` — and keep
to one or two materials a role across a whole build.

## Surface

```json
"material": "plaster/plaster/painted-plaster-005",
"surface": { "offset": [0.3, 0], "rotation": 90,
             "faces": { "0": { "texture": "roofing/tiles/clay-roof-tiles-03" }, "2": { "texture": "glass/clear/old", "emissive": 0.2 } } }
```

| Field (the part's, or a face's in `faces`) | |
|---|---|
| `texture` | A bank id; `material` is the part's |
| `scale` | `[u, v]` m a tile spans; leave it out: the bank's real size |
| `rotation` | ° the texture turns on the face |
| `offset` | `[u, v]` fraction of a tile it slides: vary it so that alike parts do not repeat (logs, stones, planks) |
| `opacity` | 0–1: below 1 the face is seen through (expensive: a pass of its own) |
| `emissive` | 0–1: lights itself, its colour as bright again whatever lights it (≈ Second Life's full bright) |
| `glow` | 0–1: a halo round it |
| `gloss` | 0–1: polished, 1 a mirror |
| `metal` | 0–1: how metallic at least |
| `reflect` | 0–1: how much it mirrors whatever its colour |
| `faces` | `{ "<face>": { …any of the above } }` by face number (0–8); a face's own wins |

How a texture runs: a box's top and bottom run u along its x; its four sides run u level and v up;
a cylinder's side runs u round and v along its axis. Boards along a piece lying along y:
`faces: { "0": { "rotation": 90 } }`; upright boards on a side: `rotation: 90`. The tile is laid
from each face's centre: to run courses on across the boxes of one wall, slide each box's long faces
by its centre's place along the wall and up it, in tiles (`offset`).

The bank's own effects come with the material: glass and water seen through, water rippling,
lava glowing and flowing, fences and grates cut out (catalog `look`).

## Light

```json
"light": { "on": "night", "range": 7, "color": [1, 0.72, 0.42], "intensity": 0.9, "cone": { "angle": 60, "softness": 0.4 }, "flicker": 0 }
```

- Without `light`, a part whose faces emit (`emissive`, or a bank material that glows) lights what
  is round it by itself: its colour, as bright as its brightest face, as far as its area says.
- `on`: `true` (default), `false` (off: its emission and glow off too — a lamp switched off), or
  `"night"` (on once the sun has set where it is, its emission with it).
- `range`: m, 0–10 (held to 10). `0`: it lights nothing round it but still glows — a lantern for
  looks, always lit, at no cost. (A light that reaches nothing is never switched: `"night"` needs a
  range above 0.)
- `color` linear RGB, `intensity` 0–1; `cone`: a spot down the part's own −z, `angle` half its
  width 1–90°, `softness` 0–1; `flicker` 0–1, a flame's.
- Switched on with nothing emitting, a part is a lamp of its own: white, 1, 10 m unless it says.
- **Walls stop a light when they are parts of its own object**: a lamp in a room is a part of the
  house's object. Glass lets it through. Keep a lamp outside short of other buildings' rooms.

## Collisions and behaviours

Everything is solid and drawn unless it says otherwise. The avatar is a capsule 1.8 m tall and
0.6 m wide: it steps up 0.3 m and stands on slopes to 50°. Kinds bring colliders of their own;
prims collide as their mesh, its hull when convex.

- `"phantom": true` — drawn, walked through: curtains, hanging leaves, light beams, water to wade in.
- `"collisionOnly": true` — bumped into, not drawn (faintly, in build mode): an invisible wall, a
  smooth ramp over stairs, a rail round a roof. One or the other, never both.
- `"behaviour": { "type": …, …parameters }` — what it does by itself, the same for every peer
  whether its owner is there or not; on a prim, on an object (in `objects`) or on a clone. Every
  type, its parameters with their ranges and defaults: catalog.json → `behaviours`.

  | Type | Does | Parameters |
  |---|---|---|
  | `door` | swings open and shuts by itself; a `door` kind opens its own leaf, up to 110° | `angle`, `hinge`, `trigger` — `"click"` (within 5 m), `"near"` (someone within `reach` m; it shuts once all have gone) or `"both"` — `reach` (m, 2.5), `time`, `stay` (s after a click; 0: until clicked again); prims only |
  | `slide` | slides aside and back by itself: a sliding door, a window, a hatch | `x`, `y`, `z` (m, its own axes), `trigger`, `reach`, `time`, `stay` |
  | `spin` | turns round its own z all the time: a sign, a windmill's sails, a carousel | `speed` (°/s) |
  | `move` | goes to a point and back, waiting at either end: an elevator, a ferry, a platform | `x`, `y`, `z`, `speed`, `wait` |
  | `belt` | carries whoever stands on it along its own y: an escalator, a walkway | `speed` (m/s) |
  | `route` | goes through its points on a smooth curve, round and on again or there and back, stopping a while at each if asked: a boat on a tour, a train on its line | `points` (up to 64, `[x, y, z]` m in its own frame), `speed` (m/s), `stop` (s), `at` (`"each"`: stops at every point; `"ends"`: only where it is kept and, there and back, at its last), `mode` (`"round"`, `"back"`), `face` (`"yes"`: turns to where it goes), `water` (`"yes"`: keeps its height over the sea) |

- **Doors the avatar walks through**: a door's leaf collides where it stands, so a shut door is a
  wall. Build it shut and give it `"behaviour": { "type": "door", "trigger": "both", "reach": 2.5,
  "stay": 8 }` — it opens as someone comes within 2.5 m, or on a click, and shuts by itself — or build
  it standing open (`"open": 85`). A window is solid whole.

  ```json
  "prims": [
    { "name": "door", "kind": "door", "at": [0, 2.85, 1.15], "size": [1.1, 0.3, 2.3], "turn": [0, 0, 180],
      "style": "panelled", "behaviour": { "type": "door", "angle": 90, "trigger": "both", "reach": 2.5, "stay": 8 } },
    { "name": "shop window", "shape": "cube", "at": [2, 2.9, 1.4], "size": [1.2, 0.04, 1], "material": "glass/clear/float",
      "behaviour": { "type": "slide", "x": 1.1, "stay": 0 } }
  ],
  "objects": [
    { "name": "sails", "at": [30, 12, 9], "turn": [90, 0, 0], "behaviour": { "type": "spin", "speed": 12 }, "prims": [ … ] },
    { "name": "ferry", "at": [60, 0, 0.2], "behaviour": { "type": "move", "y": 40, "speed": 2, "wait": 10 }, "prims": [ … ] }
  ],
  "clones": [ { "of": "sails", "at": [70, 12, 9], "turn": [90, 0, 30], "behaviour": { "type": "spin", "speed": -9 } } ]
  ```

  A behaviour moves its thing in its own frame: `spin` turns about its own z (stand sails up with a
  turn), `move` and `slide` go along its own axes. Parameters left out take their defaults.
- Moving things carry whoever stands on them.

## Objects, clones, trees

```json
"objects": [ { "name": "Bakery", "at": [-12, 6, 0.35], "turn": [0, 0, -80], "prims": [ … ] } ]
```

- **An object** is a frame and its parts, moved, copied and selected as one; at most 256 parts.
  Its `at` and `turn` place its frame in the build's; its prims are in its own frame: write a house
  as if it stood at the origin facing +y, then place it. Names are unique in a build.
- **A vehicle** is an object with `"vehicle": { "type": "car" | "bike" | "boat" | "train", … }` and
  a part with `"seat": true` to drive from: vehicles.md.
- **A clone** `{ "of": "<object's name>", "at": …, "turn": … }` draws that object's parts again in
  a frame of its own. Nothing is copied: change the object and every clone changes. Use it for
  whatever repeats unchanged: lamps, benches, fence sections, identical houses.
- **A tree** `{ "species": "oak", "at": [x, y], "scale": 1, "seed": 3, "turn": 40 }`: a species of
  catalog.json → `species`; the variant drawn is `seed % 6` (each variant's height and crown are in the
  catalog); `scale` 0.25–4; `turn` ° about z (none: one its seed gives); `seed` defaults to one from
  the build's name and the tree's place in the list.

## Ids and changing a build

An export from the editor (deliver.md) gives each object, clone and tree its `id`, and the anchor
`"exact": true`. Keep both when you change it: what comes back with the ids of the person's own
records changes them where they stand — an object's parts as you wrote them — and what has no id is
added. An object left out stays as it is.
